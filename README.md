# Day-3

Give a problem statement for writing a C program related to the Cloud strike breach
scenario:

Problem Statement for CS #3
Cloud strike, a cloud security provider, has suffered a breach. The attackers compromised
customer data, including usernames and passwords. Write a C program to simulate the
breach and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Objectives
1. Simulate the breach by generating a list of compromised usernames and passwords.
2. Identify potential vulnerabilities in Cloud strikeâ€™s password storage system.
3. Evaluate the strength of the compromised passwords.

Input
- A text file containing a list of usernames and passwords (e.g., credentials.txt)
- Each line of the file should contain a username and password separated by a colon (e.g.,
username:password)

Output
1. A list of compromised usernames and passwords.
2. A report identifying potential vulnerabilities in Cloudstrike's password storage system.
3. A report evaluating the strength of the compromised passwords.

Requirements
1. Use C programming language.
2. Use file input/output operations to read and write data.
3. Use string manipulation functions to process usernames and passwords.

CS3 and CS4 batch Assessment for Day#4

CONFIDENTIAL

4. Implement a simple password strength evaluation algorithm (e.g., check for length,
uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters).

Example Input File (credentials.txt)

user1: password123
user2: Password123!
user3: weak password

Evaluation Criteria
1. Correctness (40%): Does the program correctly simulate the breach and identify
potential vulnerabilities?
2. Code Quality (30%): Is the code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?
3. Password Strength Evaluation (30%): Does the program correctly evaluate the strength of
the compromised passwords?
